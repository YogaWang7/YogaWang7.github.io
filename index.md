# About Me

Hello! My name is Yujia Wang (pronounced as "Yoo-jee-ah Wong"), or you can call me Yoga. Now I am in my third year of graduate school at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/).  

# Research Interests

- **AI for good**.
- Develop and deploy AI solutions to address real-world data-driven problems and create more social impact.
- Employ an interdisciplinary approach, such as integrating insights from psychology, sociology, and economics, to make AI-based solutions explainable and insightful.

# Education

- I will finish an M.Phil. in Computer Science at Beijing Institute of Technology ([BIT](https://english.bit.edu.cn/)) in 2024, supervised by [Haoran Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-vZRFXgAAAAJ).
- I have completed **(cum laude)** a B.Sc. in Computer Science at the Huazhong Agricultural University ([HZAU](http://www.hzau.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm)) in 2020, supervised by [Jianxiao Liu](https://dblp.org/pid/60/8456.html).

# Internships
### Data Scientist @ Research Institute of [Taikang Insurance Group](https://www.taikang.com/about_en.html), Beijing, China.
- Given invoice data and insurance case data, applied machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent invoices and cases.
  - Improved prediction accuracy by 3 times compared to previous methods.
  - Discovered new characteristics of insurance fraud.
- Cleaned data in the Neo4j Database and investigated potential fraud communities. 

# Additional Activities
- I like sharing knowledge.
  - I used to serve as a volunteer instructor of HZAU, assisting non-computer science students in acquiring computer skills (e.g., fundamental knowledge of data structures and databases).
  - I wrote personal technical blogs (in Chinese though). Most of my blogs could receive a lot of likes and I loved discussing issues with people in the comment section.
- When I'm not working, I like to: 
  - play Ping Pong or try other sports,
  - stay with my <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleImage()">cats</a>,
  - enjoy extensive reading, including poems, and non-fictions.

<div id="catImage" style="display:none;">
  <img src="/assets/img/PA.png" alt="Cat Image" />
</div>

<script>
function toggleImage() {
  var x = document.getElementById("catImage");
  if (x.style.display === "none") {
    x.style.display = "block";
  } else {
    x.style.display = "none";
  }
}
</script>
